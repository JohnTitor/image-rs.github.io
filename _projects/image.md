The `image` project is a comprehensive library and center stone of an ecosystem
for decoding, encoding, representing, and manipulating images. The library
originates spawned as part of the Piston project and soon enough some of its
more popular encoders (such as `png`, `gif`, `tiff`) where split into separate
crates. In 2019 the whole collection of image libraries was split into its own
organization.

The fractal in background of the header of this page was created with the image
library! It is a variation of a long-standing
[example](https://github.com/image-rs/image/blob/master/examples/fractal.rs)
that can be found in the repository. The best part is that the crate is popular
enough that you can expirement directly on [the Rust Playground
play.rust-lang.org](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2018&gist=2e8024c1a0fdcb9aebfab712e6f0a32d).
